# COMP20007 - Design of Algorithms Project 1
## Road Network Transversal
##
## Compile the Program:
### Type "make"
## Run the Program:
### a1 -p [part] -s [start index] -d [destination index] -f [file name]
###
#### part is a number between 1 and 5 representing the part of the assignment to execute.
#### ~ part 1 - Depth-first tranversal
#### ~ part 2 - Breadth-first tranversal
#### ~ part 3 - Finding a detailed path
#### ~ part 4 - Finding all paths
#### ~ part 5 - Finding shortest path (using Dijkstra's algorithm)
#### start is a starting town index (required for all parts)
#### destination is a destination town index (required only for parts 3, 4, and 5)
#### file is the name of a text file in the current directory describing a road network in a format understood by main.c
##
## Clean the Program:
### Type "make clean"
