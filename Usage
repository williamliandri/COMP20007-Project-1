1. Download sample.tar.gz to your computer (better in an empty folder), then execute "tar -zxvf sample.tar.gz". If you downloaded the folder, just ignore this step.
2. Place test.sh in the folder which have all your codes with Makefile and vicroads.txt
3. Use the terminal, change to the directory with the script, then "./test.sh <path to sample>"
Note: If it says permission deny, execute "chmod u+x test.sh", then try step 3 again.
